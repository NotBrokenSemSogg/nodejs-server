# Node.JS Server

To run the server, just open up a terminal within the directory and type `npm start`, but you should already know that. :P

The webpages contents and assets should be placed in ./public, and should at least include an index.html page, and an 404.html page.

btw this is scuffed af just beware 🙏🙏
